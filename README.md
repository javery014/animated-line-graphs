# Animated Line Charts Demo

This repository holds a series of tags which represents the different stages working our way up to an animated line graph using react, react-spring, and svg.

This demo was created with `create-react-app`. So, to try it out yourself, checkout the code, run `npm install`, and then run `npm run start` to see the project run.

Check out the post on Medium for more information about the code in this repository.
